 - gob_stk, cf_dat, fall_dat and ta_hapi decompression methods aren't

 - ja2_slf have on workaround file witch masks dir

 - gta3_img size of file is always aligned to 0x800 due to lack of information
   about exactly size

 - artifex_cub - files > 4GiB are not supported

 - twow_wd flags > 0x2B handling is most likely wrong. There must be way to
   better handling directory entries after those.
